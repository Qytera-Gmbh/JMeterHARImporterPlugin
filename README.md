# README

This JMeter plugin allows users to import HTTP Archive (HAR) files into their test plans. 
HAR files contain a log of a web browser's interaction with a website, including all HTTP 
requests and responses. This plugin parses the HAR file and creates corresponding HTTP 
requests in JMeter, making it easy to reproduce real-world traffic in your load tests.

# Deploy and Test

Execute `run.bat`, maybe the path to your JMeter installation must be adapted to the right location `-Djmeter.path=C:/scoop/apps/jmeter/current`.
